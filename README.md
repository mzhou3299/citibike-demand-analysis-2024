# Citi Bike Demand Analysis (2024)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes NYC Citi Bike ridership across 2024 to understand how **geography, weather, and events** influence demand.  
The goal is to identify clear usage patterns and highlight operational implications for bike-share management.

## Key Insights & Visuals

### 1. Station Demand Map
![Station Demand](figures/station_demand.png)  
Hotspots are concentrated in **Midtown and Downtown Manhattan** as well as parts of **Brooklyn**.  
Outer borough stations show lower but steadier usage, suggesting a split between **commuter-heavy cores** and **residential stability**.

---

### 2. Neighborhood Variability
![Station Variance](figures/station_variance.png)  
Stations in the top 20 neighborhoods form distinct clusters:  
- Midtown/Downtown: **high demand, high variance** (commuter and tourist flows).  
- Outer boroughs: **lower demand, lower variance** (consistent neighborhood trips).  
This highlights how station type drives both volume and volatility.

### 3. Weather Effects
- **Temperature**: Ridership peaks in the **80â€“90Â°F range**, boosted by summer tourism and longer daylight.  
- **Precipitation**: Even light rain sharply reduces rides, with heavy rain cutting usage to near zero.

Weather is a strong, immediate driver of demand â€” making it essential for operational forecasting.

![Temp vs Precip Heatmap](figures/temp_precip_heatmap.png)  

This heatmap shows average rides per 30min by **temperature (Â°F)** and **precipitation (mm)**.  
Key patterns:  
- Ridership holds up in cool, dry weather.  
- Even light rain causes sharp declines.  
- Heavy rain almost eliminates demand, regardless of temperature.  

ðŸ‘‰ Rain is a **bigger suppressor of demand than cold** â€” critical for forecasting and operations.

### 4. Seasonality
![Monthly Rides](figures/monthly_trend.png)  
Monthly totals follow a clear curve:  
- **Winter lows** (Januaryâ€“February).  
- **Spring climb** (Marchâ€“May).  
- **Summer peak** (Julyâ€“August).  
- **Fall tapering** (Septemberâ€“November).  

This mirrors recreational cycling patterns and highlights capacity stress during summer.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, Citi Bike could:

- **Dynamic rebalancing** â†’ Concentrate bike movement in Midtown and Brooklyn hubs during peak hours.  
  ![Station Demand](figures/station_demand.png)  
  *High-demand clusters highlight where rebalancing trucks deliver the most impact â€” targeting these areas reduces stockouts and idle docks.*

- **Seasonal planning** â†’ Expand fleet size and staffing in the summer months to absorb surges.  
  ![Monthly Rides](figures/monthly_trend.png)  
  *Summer peaks show the system strains under higher demand; scaling up capacity seasonally ensures smoother rider experience.*

- **Weather-aware strategy** â†’ Integrate rain forecasts into redistribution and staffing decisions.  
  ![Temperature Ã— Precipitation](figures/temp_precip_heatmap.png)  
  *Even light rain suppresses demand more than cold â€” short-term ops adjustments should focus on rainy windows, not just temperature swings.*

- **Expansion opportunities** â†’ Invest in outer-borough neighborhoods with consistent, moderate demand.  
  ![Expansion Opportunities](figures/expansion_opportunities.png)  
  *Low-variance, steadily used stations suggest reliable everyday trips; expanding here steadily grows the user base without volatility.*

- **Consolidation opportunities** â†’ Reevaluate underused or volatile stations that strain resources.  
  ![Consolidation Opportunities](figures/consolidation_opportunities.png)  
  *Stations with persistently low ridership or extreme variability may warrant consolidation, relocation, or redesign to improve efficiency.*
